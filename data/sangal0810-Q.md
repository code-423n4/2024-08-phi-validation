[L-1]: Confusion Among Users Due to Copying of Existing Credentials:

## Description
This vulnerability allows malicious actors to copy an existing credential (cred) and create a new one with the same or similar artwork, leading to confusion among users. The presence of multiple credentials with nearly identical content can make it difficult for collectors and users to distinguish between the original and the copied versions, thereby undermining the platform's integrity and user experience.

## Impact:
1.	User Confusion: The existence of multiple credentials with the same or similar artwork can confuse users who may struggle to determine which credential is the original or holds more value. This can lead to poor decision-making, such as purchasing or collecting a copied credential instead of the original.
2.	Devaluation of Original Credentials: The original credential may lose its uniqueness and value if copied versions proliferate on the platform. Collectors may be less willing to invest in credentials if they believe they are not getting exclusive content.
3.	Undermining Artist and Curator Efforts: Both artists and curators may feel demotivated if their original work is easily copied and presented as new credentials by other users. This could lead to a decrease in the quality and quantity of contributions to the platform.
4.	Erosion of Platform Trust: The overall trust in the platform could erode if users feel that credentials are not adequately protected from duplication. This could result in a decline in user engagement and the perceived value of credentials issued on the platform.

## Recommendations:
1.	Credential Hashing: Implement a credential hashing mechanism that generates a unique identifier for each credential based on its content. This hash can be used to prevent the creation of duplicate credentials by comparing new submissions against existing hashes.
2.	Unique Content Verification: Introduce a verification process where curators or verifiers check the content of new credentials against existing ones to ensure that they are unique and not mere copies of previously issued credentials.
3.	Distinctive Metadata Requirements: Enforce strict metadata requirements for credentials, ensuring that each new credential must have sufficiently distinctive features (e.g., title, description, artwork) that differentiate it from existing ones. This will reduce the likelihood of confusion among users.
4.	Report and Penalty System: Create a reporting mechanism that allows users to flag credentials they suspect are copies of existing ones. Implement a penalty system for users who repeatedly attempt to submit copied credentials, such as fines, suspension, or banning.
5.	Whitelist Artist and Curator Addresses: Implement a whitelisting system where only verified and trusted artist and curator addresses can create credentials. This will help maintain the originality and integrity of the content on the platform, ensuring that users can trust the uniqueness of the credentials they collect.

```

- **Issue Type:** Invalid Validation: Functionality Bug / Interface Inconsistency

#### Description:
The contract defines two `uri` functions with different signatures:
- `function uri(uint256 tokenId_) public view override returns (string memory)`
- `function uri(uint256 tokenId_, address minter_) public view returns (string memory)`

These functions perform similar tasks but differ in their parameters. This overloading could lead to confusion or unexpected behavior when the contract interacts with external systems or smart contracts that expect a single `uri` function. The overloaded function signature might result in calling the unintended function, especially if the function call is made through an interface that doesn't distinguish between the two signatures.

#### Impact:
The overloading of the `uri` function could cause unintended behavior or errors when interacting with the contract, especially in external systems or third-party smart contracts expecting only one version of the function. This is particularly problematic when those systems are not designed to handle overloaded functions, leading to potential mismatches in returned data and contract functionality.

While this issue does not pose a direct security risk, it can cause functionality issues, leading to a degraded user experience or potential integration problems.

#### Proof of Concept (PoC):

Consider an external smart contract or system that interacts with this contract to fetch the URI of a token:

```solidity
interface IPhiNFT1155 {
    function uri(uint256 tokenId_) external view returns (string memory);
}

contract ExternalContract {
    IPhiNFT1155 public nftContract;

    constructor(address nftAddress) {
        nftContract = IPhiNFT1155(nftAddress);
    }

    function fetchTokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (string memory) {
        return nftContract.uri(tokenId); // Potential confusion on which uri() function to call
    }
}
```

Here, the external contract expects to interact with a single `uri` function. However, due to overloading, there is potential confusion on which `uri` function will be called, depending on how the interface resolves the overloaded signatures.

#### Mitigation:
To mitigate this issue, the contract should be refactored to avoid overloading the `uri` function. Instead, consider using distinct function names that clearly indicate their purpose and expected parameters.

##### Proposed Mitigation Code:

```solidity
// Original overloaded function
function uri(uint256 tokenId_, address minter_) public view returns (string memory) {
    if (bytes(advancedTokenURI[tokenId_][minter_]).length > 0) {
        return advancedTokenURI[tokenId_][minter_];
    } else {
        return phiFactoryContract.getTokenURI(_tokenIdToArtId[tokenId_]);
    }
}

// Refactor to avoid overloading
function minterSpecificURI(uint256 tokenId_, address minter_) public view returns (string memory) {
    if (bytes(advancedTokenURI[tokenId_][minter_]).length > 0) {
        return advancedTokenURI[tokenId_][minter_];
    } else {
        return phiFactoryContract.getTokenURI(_tokenIdToArtId[tokenId_]);
    }
}
```

With this refactor:
- The original `uri` function with the single `tokenId_` parameter remains unchanged.
- The overloaded `uri` function is renamed to `minterSpecificURI`, clearly differentiating its purpose and eliminating the overloading issue.

#### Conclusion:
This proactive measure enhances the overall robustness and maintainability of the contract.

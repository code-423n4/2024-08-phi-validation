### [M-1] Centralization Risk in Upgrade Authorization

**Description:**
The `_authorizeUpgrade` function is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier, which could lead to centralization risk,
particularly in decentralized systems where power should be distributed to prevent any single point of control.

**Impact:**
This centralization risk could result in unilateral decisions being made regarding contract upgrades, potentially
undermining the trust and decentralization principles of the protocol. It may also expose the protocol to greater risks
if the ownerâ€™s private key is compromised.

**Proof of Concept:**
The current implementation of the `_authorizeUpgrade` function is as follows:

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner {
  // This function is intentionally left empty to allow for upgrades
}
```

This function allows the owner to authorize any upgrade without additional oversight.

**Recommended Mitigation:**
To mitigate this centralization risk, it is recommended to implement a multi-signature wallet or a DAO-based governance
mechanism for authorizing upgrades. This would distribute the decision-making process, ensuring that any upgrades are
approved by a broader group of stakeholders. An example implementation could be:

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override {
  require(DAO.isApproved(newImplementation), "Upgrade not approved by DAO");
}
```

This requires the new implementation to be approved by a DAO before it can be authorized, reducing the centralization
risk.

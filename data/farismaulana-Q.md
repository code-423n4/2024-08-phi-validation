## Summary

The `withdraw` function is called whenever owner wants to withdraw ether from the contract. Considering the design of the `PhiFactory` contract is not supposed to hold ether and lack of receive/fallback function making `withdraw` function redundant or unusable.

## Tools Used

Manual review

## Recommendation

There are two recommendations:

1. Remove the withdraw Function: If the contract is not supposed to handle ether, the withdraw function should be removed to avoid confusion and potential security issues.
2. Implement receive or fallback Function: If there is a possibility of receiving ether (even accidentally), implementing a minimal receive or fallback function would allow the contract to handle and withdraw such ether.
